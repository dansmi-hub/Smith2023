  abstract = {It is widely recognized that healthy ecosystems can provide considerable benefits to people, including food, timber, freshwater, protection from floods and much of what we call quality of life. A global review of these ecosystem services carried out as part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) provided a framework for national and local studies. Using the MEA approach, this paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by the Somerset Levels and Moors wetland system in southwest England. This wetland provides a series of important services that are beneficial locally, regionally and globally, including grazing for cattle, carbon sequestration, flood water storage, recreation and archaeology. Some services are synergistic and reinforcing; for example, maintaining wet conditions supports wetland bird life that maintains biological diversity, attracts tourists, protects archaeological artefacts and reduces CO2 emissions; raising water levels to or above the ground leads to net greenhouse gas uptake by the wetland. Other services are potentially conflicting, for example raising water levels may reduce potential flood water storage and increase methane emissions. Comparison of the services of the wetland with those of drier habitats reveals for example that carbon sequestration, bird habitat provision and hay production is greater in wetlands, whilst grazing quality may decline and plant diversity may be reduced in the short term and distributions of disease vectors may be altered by wetland restoration through raising water levels. Management decisions affecting wetlands may necessitate a trade-off of ecosystem services. Editor Z.W.

The longevity of the aquatic stages of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) dictates the rate of production of adults and hence the intensity of disease transmission. We examined how temperature influences the survival of larval stages (larvae and pupae) of                Anopheles gambiae                Giles                sensu stricto                and subsequent adult production of this most efficient malaria vector. Groups of 30 mosquitoes were reared at constant temperatures (from 10 to 40{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C) from the first instar and observed until death or metamorphosis of the last individual. Larvae developed into adults at temperatures ranging from 16 to 34{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C. Larval survival was shortest ({$<\quad$}7{$\quad$}days) at 10{\textendash}12{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C and 38{\textendash}40{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C, and longest ({$>\quad$}30{$\quad$}days) at 14{\textendash}20{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C. Within the temperature range at which adults were produced, larval mortality was highest at the upper range 30{\textendash}32{$\quad$}{\textdegree}C, with death (rather than adult emergence) representing over 70\% of the terminal events. The optimal survival temperatures were lower than the temperatures at which development was quickest, suggesting a critical relationship between temperature and the life cycle of the insect. These data provide fundamental information about                An.{$\quad$}gambiae s.s.                adult productivity at different temperatures, which may facilitate the construction of process-based models of malaria risk in Africa and the development of early warning systems for epidemics.},

Food scarcity frequently has effects on the inducible defences of prey, but no consistent pattern of food{\textendash}predation risk interaction is known.                                            2.\hspace{0.6em}In this study the combined effect of food shortage and predation-risk perception in larvae of the mosquito                Culex pipiens                was investigated. Water exposed to the aquatic predator bug                Notonecta glauca                was used as a source of predation intimidation. Mosquito larvae were reared in three different media containing either no predator cues or the cues of                N. glauca                that had been fed on either                C. pipiens                larvae or on                Daphnia magna                . Food was provided in favourable or limited amount for these set-ups.                                            3.\hspace{0.6em}The results showed that chemical cues from the predators fed with prey's conspecifics caused a decreased survival, delayed pre-imaginal development, and reduction in body size of emerged mosquitoes, whereas chemical cues from predators fed with                D. magna                caused only delayed development. Food scarcity significantly exacerbates the negative effect of the predator cues on pre-imaginal development of                C. pipiens                . Effects of the cues on larval development and body size of imagoes are significantly stronger for females than for males.                            4.\hspace{0.6em}The present study suggests that when food is limited, predators can affect population dynamics of prey not only by direct predation, but also by inducing lethal and sublethal effects due to perception of risk imposed by chemical cues. To understand the effects of predators on mosquito population dynamics, environmental parameters such as food deficiency should be considered.},

  abstract = {As a result of numerous successful invasions by both Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Ades aegypti (L.), the current worldwide distributions of these mosquito species overlap. Shared larval habitats and shifts in the distribution and abundance of resident A. albopictus or A. aegypti after the establishment of the other species suggest that competitive displacement occurs. Experiments on larval competition between North American populations of the two species showed that A. albopictus has the competitive advantage under local field conditions, which apparently accounts for displacement of A. aegypti from much of the United States after the invasion of A. albopictus. The role of competition, and potential shifts of competitive advantage in different parts of their worldwide ranges are unknown, but variation due to intraspecific or environmental differences is possible. In the current study, we measured the performance of larvae of Brazilian populations of A. albopictus and A. aegypti competing under field conditions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Finite rates of increase for each species were estimated and the effects of species composition, larval density, and leaf litter resource levels were determined. A. albopictus maintained positive population growth at higher combined densities and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. A. albopictus showed higher survivorship than A. aegypti under all treatments and leaf litter resource levels. These results indicate that in Brazil, just as in North America, A. albopictus is a superior larval competitor to A. aegypti when exploiting leaf litter resources. Our results further suggest that this competitive advantage for A. albopictus is likely to be independent of mosquito population origin, local environmental conditions, and local differences in the types of leaves that form the resource base of the aquatic habitats of larvae.},

  abstract = {Mosquito borne diseases are a group of infections that affect humans. Emerging or reemerging diseases are those that (re)occur in regions, groups or hosts that were previously free from these diseases: dengue virus; chikungunya virus; Zika virus; West Nile fever and malaria. In Europe, these infections are mostly imported; however, due to the presence of competent mosquitoes and the number of trips both to and from endemic areas, these pathogens are potentially emergent or re-emergent. Present and future climatic conditions, as well as meteorological, environmental and demographic aspects are risk factors for the distribution of different vectors and/or diseases. This review aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on the transmission of mosquito borne diseases and those factors potentially affecting their transmission risk of them in six southern European countries with similar environmental conditions: Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, we would identify those factors potentially affecting the (re)introduction or spread of mosquito vectors. This task has been undertaken with a focus on the environmental and climatic factors, including the effects of climate change. We undertook a systematic review of the vectors, diseases and their associations with climactic and environmental factors in European countries of the Mediterranean region. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and used explicit and systematic methods to identify, select and critically evaluate the studies which were relevant to the topic. We identified 1302 articles in the first search of the databases. Of those, 160 were selected for full-text review. The final data set included 61 articles published between 2000 and 2017.39.3\% of the papers were related with dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus or their vectors. Temperature, precipitation and population density were key factors among others. 32.8\% studied West Nile virus and its vectors, being temperature, precipitation and NDVI the most frequently used variables. Malaria have been studied in 23\% of the articles, with temperature, precipitation and presence of water indexes as the most used variables. The number of publications focused on mosquito borne diseases is increasing in recent years, reflecting the increased interest in that diseases in southern European countries. Climatic and environmental variables are key factors on mosquitoes' distribution and to show the risk of emergence and/or spread of emergent diseases and to study the spatial changes in that distributions.},

Usutu virus, another flavivirus, came to prominence in 2001, when it was identified as the agent responsible for a drop in the bird population in Austria; previously this encephalitic virus was found only in birds and mosquitoes in Africa. Sindbis virus, a pathogenic alphavirus that causes arthritis, is widespread throughout Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia, infecting a range of arthropods and vertebrates and is genetically related to encephalitic viruses in North America. Currently there is no evidence that any of these viruses cause disease in the UK. Here the presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies is reported in the sera of resident and migrant birds in the UK, implying that each of these viruses is being introduced to UK birds, possibly by mosquitoes. This is supported by nucleotide sequencing that identified three slightly different sequences of WNV RNA in tissues of magpies and a blackbird. The detection of specific neutralizing antibodies to WNV in birds provides a plausible explanation for the lack of evidence of a decrease in the bird population in the UK compared with North America. The potential health risk posed to humans and animals by these viruses circulating in the UK is discussed.},

Here, we used live larvae of common house mosquito Culex pipiens to test the efficiencies of the invasive fish Gambusia holbrooki and the IUCN endangered fish Aphanius iberus to manage mosquitoes at three ecologically relevant concentrations of algae and clay. Both species reduced mosquito abundance in aquaria and outdoor mesocosms though A. iberus reduced it at a slower pace. However, G. holbrooki preferentially captured larger larvae at all fish sizes, whereas smaller individuals of A. iberus captured higher number of smaller larvae. Algal turbidity, but not clay, reduced the efficiency of both species, probably because of an adaptation to inorganic turbidity. Fish efficiency was not reduced in mesocosms where fish captured mosquito larvae interacting with natural invertebrate assemblages. Managers should maintain algal turbidity at\,{$<$}\,10 FTU based on the visual detection threshold for both species. Our study shows that algal turbidity threatens the potential of waterbodies to naturally control mosquitoes and discusses why the faster foraging rates of alien species such as G. holbrooki should not be used to justify more introductions.},

Manipulating or introducing an auto-reproducing predator into the ecosystem may provide sustained biological control of pest populations. The selection of a biological agent should be based on its self-replicating capacity, preference for the target pest population in the presence of alternate natural prey, adaptability to the introduced environment, and overall interaction with indigenous organisms. In order to achieve an acceptable range of control, a sound knowledge of various attributes of interactions between the pest population and the predator to be introduced is desirable. Biological larviciding for the control of mosquito borne diseases is feasible and effective only when breeding sites are relatively few or are easily identified and treated. Larval control appears to be promising in urban areas, given that the density of humans needing protection is higher than the limited number of breeding sites. Since 1937, fish have been employed for controlling mosquito larvae. Different types of fish have been used so far in this operational technique. However, use of fish of indigenous origin is found to be more appropriate in this operation. This review presents information on different larvivorous fish species and the present status of their use in mosquito control and provides a ready reference for workers involved and interested in mosquito research.},

Effects on predators and competitors could, however, be a concern as               Anopheles gambiae s.l               . is preyed upon in all life stages. We overview the literature and assess the strength of the ecological interactions identified. Most predators identified consume many other insect species and there is no evidence that any species preys exclusively on any anopheline mosquito. There is one predatory species with a specialisation on blood-fed mosquitoes including               An. gambiae s.l               .. Evarcha culicivora is a jumping spider, known as the vampire spider, found around Lake Victoria. There is no evidence that these salticids require               Anopheles               mosquitoes and will readily consume blood-fed               Culex               . Interspecific competition studies focus on other mosquitoes of larval habitats. Many of these take place in artificial cosms and give contrasting results to semi-field studies. This may limit their extrapolation regarding the potential impact of reduced               An. gambiae               numbers. Previous mosquito control interventions are informative and identify competitive release and niche opportunism; so while the identity and relative abundance of the species present may change, the biomass available to predators may not.},

  abstract = {Environmental concerns and insecticide resistance threaten the sustained efficacy of mosquito control approaches which remain reliant on synthetic chemicals. Plant-based extracts may be an environmentally sustainable and effective alternative to contemporary mosquito control approaches; however, the efficacies of many possible plant-based extracts remain untested. The present study examines the effects of extracts from three floating and three submerged aquatic plants on larval mosquito Culex pipiens mortality, and development to pupal and adult stages. Physical impacts of floating plant species on mosquito mortality and development are also examined. Extracts of Lagarosiphon major and Lemna minuta were toxic, causing significantly increased mosquito mortality compared to plant-free controls. Effects of Azolla filiculoides, Crassula helmsii, Elodea canadensis and Lemna minor were statistically unclear, yet in some cases tended to increase pupal and larval numbers at high extract concentrations. Surface coverage of all floating Lemna species drove significant mosquito mortality through mechanical processes which likely impeded surface respiration by larval mosquitoes. In particular, high-density mats of L. minuta consistently caused total larval mortality. The present study thus suggests that targeted use of specific aquatic plants could assist in mosquito control protocols. However, as the chemical composition of botanic material will differ across spatial and temporal gradients, even for a singular species, localised assessment of the efficacy of plant-based extracts from within areas experiencing problematic mosquito control is required. The application of aquatic plants that are both toxic to larvae and are effective physical control agents presents an economic and effective method of mosquito control.},

Mosquito management is overviewed to include: the use of larvicides, source reduction in intertidal wetlands and management in freshwater systems. There is not a great deal of information on mosquitoes and freshwater systems, except for constructed wetlands and they are considered separately. We then consider restoration mainly in the context of wetlands that have been the subject of habitat modification for mosquito control. Land use and climate change, as they affect mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit, are also reviewed, as this will affect wetlands via management activities. Finally the review addresses the critical issue of balancing health, both human and environmental, in an adaptive framework. It concludes that there is a need to ensure that both mosquito and wetland management communicate and integrate to sustain wetland and human health.},

  abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

However, the effects of urbanization on mosquito communities are still only poorly known. Here, we evaluate how land-use characteristics are related to the abundance and community composition of mosquitoes in an area with endemic circulation of numerous mosquito-borne pathogens. We collected 340 829 female mosquitoes belonging to 13 species at 45 localities spatially grouped in 15 trios formed by 1 urban, 1 rural and 1 natural area. Mosquito abundance and species richness were greater in natural and rural areas than in urban areas. Environmental factors including land use, vegetation and hydrological characteristics were related to mosquito abundance and community composition. Given the differing competences of each species in pathogen transmission, these results provide valuable information on the transmission potential of mosquito-borne pathogens that will be of great use in public and animal health management by allowing, for instance, the identification of the priority areas for pathogen surveillance and vector control.},

For mosquito-borne viruses to persist in temperate areas, transovarial transmission in vectors or overwintering in either hosts or diapausing vectors must occur to facilitate autochthonous transmission. We undertook surveillance of hosts and vectors in 2021 to elucidate whether USUV had overwintered in the United Kingdom (UK) following its initial detection there in 2020. From 175 dead bird submissions, we detected 1 case of USUV infection, in a blackbird, from which a full USUV genome was derived. Using a molecular clock analysis, we demonstrate that the 2021 detection shared a most recent common ancestor with the 2020 Greater London, UK, USUV sequence. In addition, we identified USUV-specific neutralizing antibodies in 10 out of 86 serum samples taken from captive birds at the index site, demonstrating in situ cryptic infection and potential sustained transmission. However, from 4966 mosquitoes, we detected no USUV RNA suggesting that prevalence in the vector community was absent or low during sampling. Combined, these results suggest that USUV overwintered in the UK, thus providing empirical evidence for the continued northward expansion of this vector-borne viral disease. Currently, our detection indicates geographically restricted virus persistence. Further detections over time will be required to demonstrate long-term establishment. It remains unclear whether the UK, and by extension other high-latitude regions, can support endemic USUV infection.},

  abstract = {Humans have altered ecosystems worldwide, and it is important to understand how this land use change impacts infectious disease transmission in humans and animals. We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30~years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9\%) were observational, 30.8\% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3\%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9\%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4\% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4\% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4\% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.},

  abstract = {The saltwater mosquito, Aedes vigilax, is prolific in coastal wetlands including mangroves and saltmarshes. Ae. vigilax is a vector for arboviruses such as Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses, with significant consequences for human health and economic productivity. In Australia the dominant form of mosquito control is chemicals. For mangroves, this is because there is a critical lack of knowledge supporting alternative approaches, such as environmental modification or biological control using larvivorous fish. This review examines the potential of fish as biological agents for the control of mosquito larvae in mangroves. We consider two key aspects: how larvivorous fish use mangroves; and can larvivorous fish reduce larval mosquito populations sufficiently to provide effective mosquito control? The link between fish and mangroves is reasonably well established, where mangroves act as refuge habitat for small and juvenile fish. Also, research has established that fish can be significant predators of mosquitoes, and therefore may be effective control agents. However, studies of fish activity within mangroves are limited to study of the fringe of the mangroves and not the internal structure of mangrove basins and as a result, fish populations within these areas remain unstudied. Also, until recently there was little appreciation of the mangrove-mosquito habitat relationship and, as a consequence, the importance of the mangrove basin as the key mosquito habitat has also been overlooked in the literature. Similarly, the predator/prey relationships between fish and mosquitoes within mangrove basin environments also remain unstudied, and therefore the importance of fish for mosquito management in mangrove basins is not known. There are substantial knowledge gaps regarding the potential of fish in controlling larval mosquitoes in mangroves. The gaps include: understanding of how larvivorous fish use mangrove basins; the nature of the fish-mosquito predator/prey relationship in mangrove basins; and whether larvivorous fish are effective as a mosquito control option in mangroves.},

  abstract = {Global wetland loss means constructed urban wetlands are an increasingly valuable resource for conservation. However, priorities for managing urban wetlands for conservation are often seen to conflict with management to reduce potential mosquito risks, such as nuisance biting and pathogen transmission. Understanding the ecological consequences of wetland management practices is vital to maximize the conservation value of urban wetlands without negatively impacting public health; however, management practices are often untested. We conducted a landscape-scale experiment to test the ecological impacts of an existing urban wetland management regime, in which a group of urban wetlands are drained annually to reduce the abundance of an invasive fish, the plague minnow Gambusia holbrooki, and then refilled to provide breeding habitat for a threatened frog, the green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea. We collected and compared aquatic macroinvertebrates and mosquito larvae from these refilled wetlands, and adjacent undrained wetlands, as well as sampling adult mosquito populations on four occasions across summer and autumn. Wetland draining had a significant effect on aquatic macroinvertebrates and larval mosquitoes. Twice as many macroinvertebrates were collected from drained wetlands compared to undrained wetlands, and almost all mosquito larvae were collected from drained wetlands. Differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages and larval mosquitoes at drained and undrained wetlands decreased over time, but total macroinvertebrate abundance and taxa richness did not. Synthesis and applications. While conserving threatened habitats and species is vitally important, our results highlight how wetland management practices can unintentionally impact non-target species, and potentially public health. As constructed urban wetlands become more common, so too does the need for routine maintenance and management of threatened and invasive species. It is essential that future design and management of urban wetlands considers the impact mosquitoes might have on humans. Pre-emptive action to control geographically relevant vectors of mosquito-borne pathogens and nuisance biting species would reduce human exposure to mosquitoes and associated negative impacts, and increase positive conservation outcomes associated with urban wetlands.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections. Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence{\textendash}absence data and those trained on abundance data. Species distribution models trained on presence{\textendash}absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 0{$\cdot$}32 (SE {$\pm$} 0{$\cdot$}12) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence{\textendash}absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 0{$\cdot$}05 (SE {$\pm$} 0{$\cdot$}01) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence. Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence{\textendash}absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence{\textendash}absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence{\textendash}absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.},

Many examples of predator-prey interactions from freshwaters suggest that apparent predator preferences result more from the relative vulnerabilities of prey than any positive choice by the predator.                          2. The rank order of vulnerability of seven invertebrate prey to nine invertebrate predators was measured in the laboratory. The ranks were used as a measure of relative vulnerability.                            3. The vulnerability of individuals of               Simocephalus vetulus               (Muller) (Crustacea: Cladocera) to predation by               Enallagma cyathigerum               (Char-pentier) (Insecta: Odonata) and               Notonecta glauca               L, (Insecta: Hemiptera) was investigated in the presence of alternative prey of differing relative vulnerabilities, based on the rank order measures.                                         4. With               E. cyathigerum               , vulnerability of individual               S. vetulus               depended greatly on the relative vulnerability of other prey types available.

  abstract = {The abundance of mosquito larvae and adult production were measured in 3 vegetation treatments and 2 species of emergent macrophytes in replicated wetland mesocosms (12 x 80 m). During the 8-wk study, no significant differences were found in abundances of larvae and emerging adult mosquitoes among the vegetation treatments: 100\% of the surface area in emergent vegetation, 50\% of the surface area in emergent vegetation in 5-m-wide rows, and 50\% of the surface area in emergent vegetation in 10-m-wide rows. Mosquito larvae (predominantly Culex tarsalis and Anopheles hermsi) were significantly more abundant in inundated bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus) than in inundated cattail (Typha sp.). Adult emergence from vegetated zones containing bulrush also was significantly greater than from cattail. The failure of reduced emergent vegetation coverage to provide a significant reduction in mosquito production from the vegetated zones of the wetlands might have been caused by favorable conditions for mosquito oviposition and larval development after vegetation management and by the ineffectiveness of mosquito predators in emergent vegetation. A 50\% reduction of vegetation did not significantly reduce the water quality of the wetland effluent; however, narrower rows ({$<$}5 m wide) of vegetation may be required to reduce mosquito production from vegetated regions of the treatment wetlands. Even though the abundance of mosquito larvae in open water is typically less than in emergent vegetation, creation of open-water zones in shallow treatment wetlands ({$<$}1 m depth) by drying the wetland followed by removal of emergent vegetation with heavy equipment is unlikely to provide a significant long-term reduction of mosquito production.},

A paradigmatic case is the introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America in 1999. A decade of research on the ecology and evolution of WNV includes three findings that provide insight into the outcome of future pathogen introductions. First, WNV transmission in North America is highest in urbanized and agricultural habitats, in part because the hosts and vectors of WNV are abundant in human-modified areas. Second, after its introduction, the virus quickly adapted to infect local mosquito vectors more efficiently than the originally introduced strain. Third, highly focused feeding patterns of the mosquito vectors of WNV result in unexpected host species being important for transmission. This research provides a framework for predicting and preventing the emergence of foreign vector-borne pathogens.},

  abstract = {During the early part of the 21st century, an unprecedented change in the status of vector-borne disease in Europe has occurred. Invasive mosquitoes have become widely established across Europe, with subsequent transmission and outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus. Malaria has re-emerged in Greece, and West Nile virus has emerged throughout parts of eastern Europe. Tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, continue to increase, or, in the case of tick-borne encephalitis and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses, have changed their geographical distribution. From a veterinary perspective, the emergence of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses show that northern Europe is equally susceptible to transmission of vector-borne disease. These changes are in part due to increased globalisation, with intercontinental air travel and global shipping transport creating new opportunities for invasive vectors and pathogens. However, changes in vector distributions are being driven by climatic changes and changes in land use, infrastructure, and the environment. In this Review, we summarise the risks posed by vector-borne diseases in the present and the future from a UK perspective, and assess the likely effects of climate change and, where appropriate, climate-change adaptation strategies on vector-borne disease risk in the UK. Lessons from the outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean emphasise the need to assess future vector-borne disease risks and prepare contingencies for future outbreaks. Ensuring that adaptation strategies for climate change do not inadvertently exacerbate risks should be a primary focus for decision makers.},

  abstract = {The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing in Europe, partly due to the incursion of a number of invasive species known to be vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses, but also due to the involvement of native species in the transmission of West Nile virus and malaria. For some of these pathogens, there is a risk of the re-emergence of vector-borne diseases that were once widespread in Europe, but declined partly due to large-scale land-drainage projects. Some mosquito species exploit container habitats as breeding sites in urban areas; an adaptation to human-made micro-habitats resulting from increased urbanisation. However, many species thrive in natural wetland ecosystems. Owing to the impacts of climate change there is an urgent need for environmental adaptation, such as the creation of new wetlands to mitigate coastal and inland flooding. In some cases, these initiatives can be coupled with environmental change strategies to protect a range of endangered flora and fauna species by enhancing and extending wetland landscapes, which may by driven by European legislation, particularly in urban areas. This paper reviews field studies conducted in England to assess the impact of newly created wetlands on mosquito colonisation in a) coastal, b) urban and c) arable reversion habitats. It also considers the impact of wetland management on mosquito populations and explores the implications of various water and vegetation management options on the range of British mosquito species. Understanding the impact of wetland creation and management strategies on mosquito prevalence and the potential risk of increasing the levels of nuisance or disease vector species will be crucial in informing health and well-being risk assessments, guiding targeted control, and anticipating the social effects of extreme weather and climate change. Although new wetlands will certainly extend aquatic habitats for mosquitoes, not all species will become a major nuisance or a vector concern as a result. Understanding how the design and management of wetlands might exacerbate mosquito densities is crucial if we are to manage nuisance mosquitoes and control vector species in the event of a disease outbreak. This entomological evidence-base will ensure that control strategies achieve optimal efficacy at minimal cost.},

  abstract = {Abstract.\hspace{0.6em}               West Nile virus (WNV) transmitted by mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) infects various vertebrates, being pathogenic for birds, horses and humans. After its discovery in tropical Africa, sporadic outbreaks of WNV occurred during recent decades in Eurasia, but not the British Isles               *               . WNV reached New York in 1999 and spread to California by 2003, causing widespread outbreaks of West Nile encephalitis across North America, transmitted by many species of mosquitoes, mainly               Culex               spp. The periodic reappearance of WNV in parts of continental Europe (from southern France to Romania) gives rise to concern over the possibility of WNV invading the British Isles.                                         The British Isles have about 30 endemic mosquito species, several with seasonal abundance and other eco-behavioural characteristics predisposing them to serve as potential WNV bridge vectors from birds to humans. These include: the predominantly ornithophilic                                                   Culex pipiens                                               L. and its anthropophilic biotype                                                   molestus                                               Forsk{\aa}l; tree-hole adapted               Anopheles plumbeus               Stephens; saltmarsh-adapted                                Ochlerotatus caspius                              Pallas,               Oc               .{$\quad$}               detritus               Haliday and                                Oc. dorsalis                              (Meigen);                                                   Coquillettidia richiardii                                               Ficalbi,               Culiseta annulata               Schrank and                                Cs. morsitans                              (Theobald) from vegetated freshwater pools;                                Aedes cinereus                              Meigen,               Oc.{$\quad$}cantans               Meigen and               Oc               .{$\quad$}               punctor               Kirby from seasonal woodland pools.

Monitoring of mosquitoes and arbovirus surveillance are required to guard the British Isles against WNV outbreaks and introduction of more anthropophilic mosquitoes such as               Stegomyia albopicta               (Skuse) and               Ochlerotatus japonicus               (Theobald) that have recently invaded Europe, since they transmit arboviruses elsewhere.},

  abstract = {There has been growing interest in Europe in recent years in the establishment and spread of invasive mosquitoes, notably the incursion of Aedes albopictus through the international trade in used tires and lucky bamboo, with onward spread within Europe through ground transport. More recently, five other non-European aedine mosquito species have been found in Europe, and in some cases populations have established locally and are spreading. Concerns have been raised about the involvement of these mosquito species in transmission cycles of pathogens of public health importance, and these concerns were borne out following the outbreak of chikungunya fever in Italy in 2007, and subsequent autochthonous cases of dengue fever in France and Croatia in 2010. This article reviews current understanding of all exotic (five introduced invasive and one intercepted) aedine species in Europe, highlighting the known import pathways, biotic and abiotic constraints for establishment, control strategies, and public health significance, and encourages Europe-wide surveillance for invasive mosquitoes.},

In this study, data-driven decision tree models, generalized linear models and ordination analysis were used to identify the most important biotic and abiotic factors that affect the occurrence and abundance of mosquito larvae in Southwest Ethiopia.                                         Methods                                In total, 220 samples were taken at 180 sampling locations during the years 2010 and 2012. Sampling sites were characterized based on physical, chemical and biological attributes. The predictive performance of decision tree models was evaluated based on correctly classified instances (CCI), Cohen's kappa statistic ({$\kappa$}) and the determination coefficient (R                 2                 ). A conditional analysis was performed on the regression tree models to test the relation between key environmental and biological parameters and the abundance of mosquito larvae.                                                        Results               The decision tree model developed for anopheline larvae showed a good model performance (CCI\,=\,84\,{$\pm$}\,2\%, and {$\kappa$}\,=\,0.66\,{$\pm$}\,0.04), indicating that the genus has clear habitat requirements. Anopheline mosquito larvae showed a widespread distribution and especially occurred in small human-made aquatic habitats. Water temperature, canopy cover, emergent vegetation cover, and presence of predators and competitors were found to be the main variables determining the abundance and distribution of anopheline larvae. In contrast, anopheline mosquito larvae were found to be less prominently present in permanent larval habitats. This could be attributed to the high abundance and diversity of natural predators and competitors suppressing the mosquito population densities.                                         Conclusions               The findings of this study suggest that targeting smaller human-made aquatic habitats could result in effective larval control of anopheline mosquitoes in the study area. Controlling the occurrence of mosquito larvae via drainage of permanent wetlands may not be a good management strategy as it negatively affects the occurrence and abundance of mosquito predators and competitors and promotes an increase in anopheline population densities.},

In recent years, however, changing European and national policies with respect to farming, environment and flood management are encouraging a re-appraisal of land use in rural areas. In particular, there is scope to develop, through the use of appropriate promotional mechanisms, washland areas, which will simultaneously accommodate winter inundation, support extensive farming methods, deliver environmental benefits, and do this in a way which can underpin the rural economy. This paper explores the likely economic impacts of the development of flood storage and washland creation. In doing so, consideration is given to feasibility of this type of development, the environmental implications for a variety of habitats and species, and the financial and institutional mechanisms required to achieve implementation.},

The antisera were from rabbits immunised by injections of saline extracts of the species of               Culex               into the inguinal lymph nodes and made relatively more specific by absorption. The gut contents or whole individuals of 1098 potential predators were smeared on to filter paper and tested. The most important predators in the ponds were Odonata nymphs while those of artificial containers were larval Dytiscidae. Diptera and Araneae preyed on emerging adults. The length of time a mosquito meal remained detectable in the gut of predators varied from a minimum of 8 h for the newt               Triturus vulgaris               to 24 h for the zygopteran               Ischnura elegans               (van der Linden).

The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

  abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) explain spatial variation in community composition by contributions of the environment, biotic associations and possibly spatially structured residual covariance. They show great promise as a general analytical framework for community ecology and macroecology, but current JSDMs, even when approximated by latent variables, scale poorly on large datasets, limiting their usefulness for currently emerging big (e.g. metabarcoding and metagenomics) community datasets. Here, we present a novel, more scalable JSDM (sjSDM) that circumvents the need to use latent variables by using a Monte Carlo integration of the joint JSDM likelihood together with flexible elastic net regularization on all model components. We implemented sjSDM in PyTorch, a modern machine learning framework, which allows making use of both CPU and GPU calculations. Using simulated communities with known species{\textendash}species associations and different number of species and sites, we compare sjSDM with state-of-the-art JSDM implementations to determine computational runtimes and accuracy of the inferred species{\textendash}species and species{\textendash}environment associations. We find that sjSDM is orders of magnitude faster than existing JSDM algorithms (even when run on the CPU) and can be scaled to very large datasets. Despite the dramatically improved speed, sjSDM produces more accurate estimates of species association structures than alternative JSDM implementations. We demonstrate the applicability of sjSDM to big community data using eDNA case study with thousands of fungi operational taxonomic units (OTU). Our sjSDM approach makes the analysis of JSDMs to large community datasets with hundreds or thousands of species possible, substantially extending the applicability of JSDMs in ecology. We provide our method in an R package to facilitate its applicability for practical data analysis.},

  abstract = {Explaining and modeling species communities is more than ever a central goal of ecology. Recently, joint species distribution models (JSDMs), which extend species distribution models (SDMs) by considering correlations among species, have been proposed to improve species community analyses and rare species predictions while potentially inferring species interactions. Here, we illustrate the mathematical links between SDMs and JSDMs and their ecological implications and demonstrate that JSDMs, just like SDMs, cannot separate environmental effects from biotic interactions. We provide a guide to the conditions under which JSDMs are (or are not) preferable to SDMs for species community modeling. More generally, we call for a better uptake and clarification of novel statistical developments in the field of biodiversity modeling.},

  abstract = {Wetlands are valuable habitats that provide important social, economic, and ecological services such as flood control, water quality improvement, carbon sequestration, pollutant removal, and primary/secondary production export to terrestrial and aquatic food chains. There is disagreement about the need for mosquito control in wetlands and about the techniques utilized for mosquito abatement and their impacts upon wetlands ecosystems. Mosquito control in wetlands is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including many hard to quantify elements such as human perceptions, cultural predispositions, and political climate. In spite of considerable progress during the last decades, habitat protection and environmentally sound habitat management still remain inextricably tied to politics and economics. Furthermore, the connections are often complex, and occur at several levels, ranging from local businesses and politicians, to national governments and multinational institutions. Education is the key to lasting wetlands conservation. Integrated mosquito abatement strategies incorporate many approaches and practicable options, as described herein, and need to be well-defined, effective, and ecologically and economically sound for the wetland type and for the mosquito species of concern. The approach will certainly differ in response to disease outbreaks caused by mosquito-vectored pathogens versus quality of life issues caused by nuisance-biting mosquitoes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the ecological setting and context for mosquito control in wetlands, present pertinent information on wetlands mosquitoes, review the mosquito abatement options available for current wetlands managers and mosquito control professionals, and outline some necessary considerations when devising mosquito control strategies. Although the emphasis is on North American wetlands, most of the material is applicable to wetlands everywhere.},

However, rarely have these goals been incorporated in one project. Here we present the concept of Integrated Marsh Management (IMM), which combines the best management practices of salt marsh restoration and OMWM. Although IMM offers a comprehensive approach to ecological restoration and mosquito control, research evaluating this concept's practical implementations has been inadequate. A long-term IMM project at Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge located in a highly urbanized watershed on Long Island, New York, USA was designed to fill this knowledge gap. A combination of restoration and OMWM techniques was employed at two treatment marshes, the results monitored before and after alterations, and compared to two adjacent control marshes. The treatment marshes experienced decreased mosquito production, reduced cover of the invasive common reed (Phragmites australis), expansion of native marsh vegetation, increased killifish and estuarine nekton species abundance, as well as increased avian species diversity and waterbird abundance. This demonstration project validated the IMM conceptual approach and may serve as a case study for similar IMM projects in the future.},

  abstract = {Constructed wetlands are increasingly being installed to `polish' urban drainage and storm water by reducing contaminants before disposal into river systems. Unfortunately, they also provide habitat for mosquitoes that can be nuisance pests and transmit pathogens such as arboviruses and malaria. In Australia, Ross River virus is responsible for thousands of cases annually of a disease that is severely debilitating, has regional incidence rates often exceeding 1:1000, and costs millions of dollars in health and other impacts. Disease transmission depends on mosquito species and abundance, and extent of contact with humans; the characteristics and siting of wetlands determine hazards, and indicate risks for nuisance or disease. Mosquito control should not rely solely on chemical and biological agents. Design of wetlands is important: shallow water and dense vegetation promote mosquito production. Deeper habitats with cleaner steeper margins, and more open water, produce fewer mosquitoes. Water and vegetation management can reduce mosquitoes: aeration and sprinkler systems, and flooding and drainage regimes, can reduce larval densities; vegetation thinning can assist mosquito predators. Such measures may appear incompatible with objectives and operations of wetlands, but mosquito management must be an integral objective of modern wetland design and maintenance in order to minimise health hazards.},

The effect of one prey species on the other was asymmetrical, as indicated through prey selectivity values. Compared to open habitat, the presence of macrophytes reduced the vulnerability of mosquito larvae while the effect was reverse in the presence of sediments. When both sediment and macrophytes were present in habitats, all the predators except D. annulatus consumed more mosquito larvae than chironomid larvae. The clearance rate, an indicator of predatory efficiency, varied among the predator species and habitat types. The results suggest that the outcome of the interactions between insect predators and mosquito immatures was context-dependent and that it was mediated by the presence of alternative controphic species and the habitat complexity.},

In this study, we combined a field and a laboratory study to investigate the natural resting site and temperature preferences of mosquitoes. The field study was conducted at a forest close to Oldenburg (Lower Saxony, Germany) from May to October 2018. Mosquitoes were collected in five different natural habitats with seven replicates each. Temperature was recorded hourly at each site. Significantly more mosquitoes were collected in deadwood (predominantly Culiseta morsitans/fumipennis) and shaded herb layer (predominantly Aedes species) compared to unshaded herb layer or broadleaf and coniferous trees. GLMMs revealed resting site habitats as the best predictor to explain the observed preference patterns, but microclimatic conditions are also involved in mosquito resting site selection. Most mosquitoes were collected at resting sites with relatively colder and more stable temperatures. In concert, laboratory choice experiments with a thermal gradient ring demonstrated that Cs. morsitans/fumipennis avoid temperatures over 30 {\textdegree}C. Understanding the small-scaled resting site preferences and the related microclimatic conditions can improve mosquito collection techniques and refine the prediction of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In southern Sweden, many wetlands have been constructed, and maintaining or increasing biological diversity is often included in the aims. Some wetlands are constructed near human settlements, thus raising the problem of wetlands being associated with mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). Increased biodiversity (including mosquito diversity) is considered desirable, whereas mosquito nuisance from a human point of view is not. Adult mosquito abundance, diversity and species assemblages of constructed wetlands were compared to natural wetlands. The potential of constructed wetlands for mosquito nuisance and transmission of mosquito-borne viruses was evaluated. The study areas included five constructed and four natural wetlands. Mosquito abundance and species richness were higher in the natural than in the constructed wetlands, and showed a positive correlation with wetland size. Mosquito species assemblages formed three clusters, which were not explained by origin, size and water permanence of wetlands. In a redundancy analysis, however, mosquito faunas showed significant relationships with these variables, and size and origin of wetlands were most important. Major nuisance species (multivoltine species feeding on mammals and laying eggs on soil) were found in all wetlands, although in relatively low numbers. Risk assessment for Sindbis virus transmission showed moderate risk for two constructed wetlands near human settlements. It is concluded that small size of constructed wetlands has the advantage of low mosquito numbers from a human point of view. The use of functional groups is recommended as a tool for presenting mosquito data to the public, and for helping communication between scientists and administrative decision makers.},

Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental water butt containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100.4{$\pm$}21.3) per container than those in rural containers (77.7{$\pm$}15.1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0.9{\textdegree}C and 1.2{\textdegree}C respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK.},

  abstract = {Turbidity has both positive and negative effects on prey detection, by increasing or diminishing the contrast between prey and background due to the scattering of light. The positive effect of turbidity on prey contrast depends on the optical properties, scattering properties of suspended particles and the visual sensitivity of the predator. The positive effect of turbidity is pronounced for larval fish, given that their visual field is short, leaving fewer particles between them and their prey to scatter light and interfere with detection. This relationship, together with a decreased risk of predation, makes turbid environments more optimal for some species and size groups of fish (planktivores and fish larvae) and less so for others (adult piscivore fish). Thus, turbidity might have a structuring effect on a fish community. Recently it has been demonstrated that UV light might have positive effects on prey detection and consumption. How UV light might interact with different kinds of particles producing turbidity is not well documented.},

The abundance of larval mosquitoes (Culex sp. and Culiseta sp.) in multipurpose constructed wetlands that had undergone autumnal vegetation management intended primarily to enhance denitrifying bacteria was significantly higher than in wetlands that remained in continuous operation. Mosquito abundance in wetlands that had undergone vegetation management during autumn was much lower than that observed during spring in a previous study; nevertheless, vegetation management practices that inundate dried, felled macrophytes are contraindicated for mosquito control.},

  abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) account for biotic interactions and missing environmental predictors in correlative species distribution models. Several different JSDMs have been proposed in the literature, but the use of different or conflicting nomenclature and statistical notation potentially obscures similarities and differences among them. Furthermore, new JSDM implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence{\textendash}absence JSDMs using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each JSDM using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the JSDMs are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different JSDMs are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different JSDMs clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the JSDM that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of JSDM methods among the ecological community.},

  abstract = {Whether species interactions influence species response to environment and species ranges has always been a central question in ecology. Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) simultaneously model the species{\textendash}environment relationships of multiple species and the residual correlation between these species. These residual correlations are assumed to depict whether species co-occur less or more often than expected by the modelled species{\textendash}environment relationships, which could ultimately be attributed to species interactions, or hidden environmental information. Here, we propose to specifically test the capacity of JSDMs to detect species interactions from co-occurrence data, at different scales of data aggregation. Using a recently published point-process model, we simulated equilibrium co-occurrence patterns of species pairs by varying the strength and type of interactions (e.g. competition, predator{\textendash}prey, mutualism) as well as the prevalence of the interacting species in homogeneous environments (assuming the environment does not influence the species responses and co-occurrence). Then, we fitted JSDMs without environmental predictors, and compared the estimated residual correlations against the known interaction coefficients. JSDMs detected competition and mutualism well, but failed with predator{\textendash}prey interactions. For the latter, JSDMs predicted both negative and positive residual correlations for these kinds of interactions, depending on the prevalence of the interacting species. Interestingly, the estimated residual correlation was strongly influenced by species' prevalence and can thus not be translated to interaction strength. At increasingly coarser data resolution, the signals of negative and positive interactions became indiscernible by JSDMs, but {\textendash} reassuringly {\textendash} were rarely confounded. The underlying point-process model simulates the consequences rather than the mechanisms of interspecific interactions, and thus is better at corroborating rather than discrediting JSDMs. Nevertheless, our simple theoretical exercise pinpoints important limitations of JSDMs. In conclusion, we caution against interpreting residual correlations from JSDMs as interaction strength and against comparing these across different species and communities.},
